# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning

### 📌 Project Description
This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict the salary of an employee based on input features like experience, test score, and interview score. It was developed as part of the **Edunet IBM Internship Capstone Project**.

---

### 📊 Features
- Takes input: `experience`, `test_score`, and `interview_score`
- Predicts approximate salary using ML
- Trained using `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn
- Saves model using `joblib` for deployment or reuse

### 🛠️ Tech Stack / Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- joblib (for model saving)
